# Caladea font project

Caladea is a free modern, friendly serif font family based on Cambo (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cambo)
Designed by Carolina Giovagnoli and Andrés Torresi for Huerta Tipográfica.

Cambo is a modern Latin typeface inspired by the contrast, style and ornaments of Khmer typefaces and writing styles. Its main objective is to be used to write Latin texts in a Khmer context, but it is also an elegant choice for all kinds of texts. 

Main differences in Caladea:

- More condensed width
- New metrics
- 4 styles (regular, bold, italic, and bold italic styles)
- Character set expanded to WGL (418 glyphs)
